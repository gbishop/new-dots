# Find blue dots

This is our 3rd or 4th attempt. This time I'm going to attempt to use 
difference images to detect the appearance and disappearance of dots.

I'm linking to videos in the videos sub-folder and the associated
.txt file is my notes on manual determination of when dots appear
and page turns.
